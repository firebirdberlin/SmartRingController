            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The author is in the business of selling applications. Private information about
            the users is kept privately and is never given away or sold to third parties without
            your consent.
            Private information is deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the intention
            of the application itself. It is only stored on the users' device so that the author
            is never in the possession of private data.</p>
